# Top-Companies-in-India-based-on-their-Revenue-2023

**Introduction**

The objective of this analysis is to identify the top companies in India in terms of revenue for the year 2023. The data includes company names, industry sectors, revenues in billions of US dollars, and the headquarters location. This analysis provides insights into which companies are leading the market and how revenue is distributed across different industries and regions.

**Data Source**

The data was extracted from **Wikipedia** using web scraping techniques. The dataset was cleaned and structured into a CSV file for analysis.

**Data Structure**

The dataset contains the following columns:

**Rank:** The rank of the company based on revenue.

**Name:** The name of the company.

**Industry:** The industry in which the company operates.

**Revenue (billions US$):** The revenue of the company in billions of US dollars.

**Headquarters:** The location of the company's headquarters.

**Analysis**

**Top Companies by Revenue**

This analysis identifies the companies with the highest revenues in 2023. The data reveals the leading companies that dominate the Indian market.

**Industry Analysis**

The companies are categorized by industry to determine which sectors are generating the most revenue. This analysis helps in understanding the dominant industries in India.

**Headquarters Analysis**

The headquarters of the companies are analyzed to see how revenue is distributed across different regions in India. The top cities hosting these companies are identified and compared based on total revenue.

**Correlation Analysis: Rank vs. Revenue**

As part of the analysis, a correlation matrix was created to examine the relationship between a company's rank and its revenue.

**Findings**

The correlation matrix reveals the strength and direction of the relationship between the rank of a company and its revenue:

**Rank:** The position of the company based on its revenue.

**Revenue (billions US$):** The total revenue of the company in billions of US dollars.

**Interpretation**

A negative correlation between rank and revenue suggests that as a company's revenue increases, its rank decreases (i.e., a lower numerical rank, indicating a higher position in the list).
A positive correlation would indicate that as revenue increases, the rank number also increases (which would be unexpected in this context).

**Visualization**

A heatmap was used to visualize the correlation matrix, with color coding to represent the strength of the correlation:

**Strong negative correlation:** Indicating a high revenue corresponds with a top rank (lower rank number).

**Weak or no correlation:** Indicating no clear relationship between revenue and rank.
This correlation analysis helps in understanding whether a company's ranking is directly proportional to its revenue, providing insights into the distribution of top companies based on their financial performance.

**Visualizations**

Several visualizations are included to better understand the data:

**Bar Plot of Top Headquarters by Revenue:** This plot shows the top cities in India based on the total revenue of companies headquartered there.

**Industry-wise Revenue Distribution:** A plot illustrating the distribution of revenue across different industries.

**Top Companies by Revenue:** A bar plot showing the companies with the highest revenues.

**Correlation Heatmap:** This Heatmap is based on the Companies Rank and their Revenue.
